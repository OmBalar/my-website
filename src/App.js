            <li><b>Software Engineer, Reviewer.ly [May 2024-August 2024]</b></li>
            <li>I worked as a Software Engineer Intern to develop the website for the Reviewer.ly project at TMU’s LS3 Lab. I enhanced user profile management by implementing features to customize the profile using React.js, Next.js, and Spring Boot, leveraging react-query for efficient API interactions. I also developed a feature to view and resolve error reports, implementing an SMTP service for email notifications upon resolution, streamlining issue tracking and communication. I used OpenAPI and gRPC for efficient data retrieval from a MongoDB database, ensuring application performance and reliability while conducting thorough testing with Jest and Mockito to reduce potential bugs. During my work term, I had to address challenges in storing large profile pictures by compressing images on both the front-end and back-end, optimizing storage efficiency while maintaining image quality.</li>
